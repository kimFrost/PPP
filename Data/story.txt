He strucgles to function just barely, and hope is almost a forbidden word to him.
He continues oneward to the factory, where he will spent his next 14 hours, earning him just enough money to feed his starving family.
After his shifts ends, his mind is heavy. A dear friend lost his life today. Another one caught in the great wheels of the machine.
He drags himself through the streets towards home. He stop at the sound of music to his right. 
A pub. Through the mudgreen glass he can see people sitting at the bar. He pulls his hand into his pocket, and feels the cold coins lying there.
